## Obboarding Best of Both:
Hybrid Flow:

First-time users → redirect to onboarding until it's complete
Returning users (with profile + customers) → go straight to dashboard
On dashboard: clearly highlight if anything is missing
if (!businessProfile || !customers.length) {
  redirect("/onboarding");
}
Bonus:
Let them skip onboarding (but mark it incomplete) — and nudge them later via gentle alerts:
